Q2:Prove L is in NP
1.You are required to prove that the following problem L is in NP. To do that, you can
give a TM or define some pseudocode. The language L includes precisely those
binary strings which are encodings of pairs in the form (G, k) where G is an undirected graph and k is a natural number such that there is a subset S of the set
of edges of G having cardinality at most k and such that any node of G occurs in at
least one of the edges in S.

2. You are required to prove that the following problem L is in N P. To do that, you can
give a TM or define some pseudocode. The language L includes precisely those
binary strings which are encodings of pairs in the form (G, n) where G is an undirected graph having a path which goes through n distinct edges of G, going through each of them exactly once. Can you say anything else about the complexity of this problem?

4. You are required to prove that the following problem L is in N P. To do that,
you can give a TM or define some pseudocode. The language L includes
precisely those binary strings which are encodings of pairs in the form (G, k)

assigned a natural number between 1 and k in such a way that nodes which are
linked by an edge are assigned distinct natural numbers. 

5.  You are required to prove that the following problem L is in NP. To do that, you can give a TM or define some pseudocode. The language L includes precisely those binary strings which are encodings of pairs in the form (G, t) where G is a graph and t is a natural number, such that the nodes of G can be
partitioned into at most t sets in such a way that nodes which are part of distinct sets are not linked by any edge.
